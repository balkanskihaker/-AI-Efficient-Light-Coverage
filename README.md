# -AI-Efficient-Light-Coverage

Final Project for the Class Deep Learning.<br>
Students: Ognjen Obradović, Petar Jović 3rd. 

<b>Trying to solve the following problem</b><br>
For a 2D room find a light source that covers the most surface. Implementing a deep learning approach, we are drastically reducing the computing time needed to find the optimal solution, instead of finding a target that is close enough while providing good performance.
<h5>Figure 1: Example of a generated room</h5>

<b>Disclaimer</b><br>
This Project is just a proof of concept, therefore we will limit ourselves to creating and training on only very small images and a small number of light sources. You can change those hyperparameters as they suit your application or use. 


<i>conda_env.yml</i> file contain all necessary libraries for project.
